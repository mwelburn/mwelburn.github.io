excerpt: "I'm speaking at Dreamforce 2016 about Lightning Components & Community Builder."
---

[Dreamforce](https://dreamforce.com) 2016 is quickly approaching, and I’m in the process of preparing for a theater session that I’ll be presenting. I’m very excited to have been chosen to speak for the second year in a row.

Over the last few months I’ve spent a lot of time working on Lightning Components for Community Builder as part of [7Summits](https://7summits.com) Salesforce offerings, and have come across my fair share of gotchas and best practices. Lightning development is in its infancy, and as such there are a lot of little idiosyncrasies that either are bugs or features that are more restrictive in nature than traditional Visualforce development. The Lightning framework isn’t quite yet up to parity yet, but with Salesforce’s relentless push towards [Lightning Experience](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2015/08/future-of-crm-salesforce-lightning.html) and Community Builder, it is only a matter of time until all developers will need some level of proficiency with it. 

That being said, the session I’m presenting is [Architecting Lightning Components for Community Builder](https://success.salesforce.com/Sessions#/session/a2q3A000000LBSYQA4). In particular, I’m going to be focusing on how to enable a developer new to Community Builder to set up a functioning Lightning Component, and the major requirements to ensure you are delivering the appropriate data to the user.

I won’t be focusing on the overall best practices with Lightning Components. Unfortunately there is not enough time for that, and there are sure to be many other sessions with that content.

If you have questions about Lightning Components in Community Builder, feel free to get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelwelburn).
