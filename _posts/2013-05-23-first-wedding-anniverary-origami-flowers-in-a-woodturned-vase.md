Many months ago (almost a year ago by now), Joyce and I had our first wedding anniversary. As the date approached, I had to determine what sort of gift I needed to get for the occasion. Once I took a look online to see what the traditional gift was for the first year (<a title="Anniversaries by Year" href="http://anniversariesbyyear.com/" target="_blank">paper</a>), I realized that it was an optimal opportunity to _make_ a gift.

    The first thing that struck me was making some sort of origami flowers. After deciding that roses would be a nice flower to try, I started looking for tutorials. I ended up leveraging these three links:
  </p>

  <ul>

    </li>

    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You will notice that I have no pictures of this process, because it was maybe the most frustrating thing I&#8217;ve done in a long time. It isn&#8217;t a stretch to say I was cranking out a flower every 2-3 hours. I had done origami before&#8230;when I was a kid&#8230;but I didn&#8217;t remember it being anywhere near that hard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately, prior to making the roses, I had a much easier time turning a vase to hold the flowers. I looked online for inspiration, and came across a video of a <a title="Turning a Bud Vase" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og-UlCktwRA" target="_blank">younger clone of myself</a> who showed how he turned a bud vase. Using the following videos as templates for some of the work, I was able to make a vase in a much more relaxing manner.

    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Overall, I was quite pleased with the results. I ended up using some tools that have caused quite a bit of frustration for me in the past (spindle gouge), and it was my first attempt at a project that wasn&#8217;t a bowl and required using a tenon and drilling a hole (and not having the vase break off and go flying).
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are some pictures of the vase making process on the lathe, starting with the block of wood, shaving it down into a vase on the outside, drill a hole on the inside, and then the final product.
