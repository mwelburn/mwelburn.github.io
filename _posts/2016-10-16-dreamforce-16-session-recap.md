I had a great few days at [Dreamforce](https://dreamforce.com) 2016 connecting with a large number of internet friends, including the community around the always entertaining [Good Day, Sir!](http://www.gooddaysirpodcast.com/) podcast - a must listen for any Salesforce developers. The footprint for developers continues to grow, taking over Moscone West this year, and I can't wait to get my hands on Salesforce DX next year.

My [session](/2016/08/23/catch-me-at-dreamforce) was presented on Tuesday afternoon to a pretty strong crowd in the Lightning Theater, and it helped that everyone had to walk by it to get lunch. Unfortunately, the Theater talks were not recorded, but I did record a screencast of the presentation afterward and [uploaded it to Youtube](http://bit.ly/MW-DF16Video) in case you missed it.

Additionally, there are a number of links and resources (video, powerpoint, source code, etc.) located under [Dreamforce 16 Resources](/df16-resources). I also recorded a quick video on [how to create Community Users](http://bit.ly/CreateCommunityUsers), as that question has come up in the past.

If you have questions about the presentation, feel free to get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelwelburn).
