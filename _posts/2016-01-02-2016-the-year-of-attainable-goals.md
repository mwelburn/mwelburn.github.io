Now that 2015 has come to a close, it is an opportune time to think about my goals for the upcoming year. I did a pretty poor job of creating any sort of accountability for my 2015 goals (not even sure what they were at this point), and found that blogging my <a href="http://michaelwelburn.com/2014/01/01/new-years-resolutions-for-2014/" target="_blank">2014 goals</a> and mid-year <a href="http://michaelwelburn.com/2014/07/24/catching-2014-goals/" target="_blank">retrospective</a> rather useful for that purpose, so here is the 2016 version.

<!--more-->

Because my appetite often ends up setting unrealistic expectations, I decided this year I would create more realistic goals with the &#8220;opportunity to exceed&#8221;. I&#8217;m also going to take a page from a friend on his goal setting, declaring quantifiable numerical values in order to track tangible progress.

I&#8217;ve found that when I create these lists, there end up being two main themes:

  * Professional / Career Development
  * Get off the Computer

# Professional / Career Development

## Write 24 Blog Posts

Kicking off the list with a pretty obvious one. I dropped the ball on posting new content in 2015 after a pretty successful 2013/2014. I&#8217;ve got a variety of excuses as to why that was, but there isn&#8217;t much that can excuse a posting cadence of &#8220;once every 3 months&#8221;. Setting the bar at 2 posts a month seems pretty reasonable.

## Collect All Trailhead Badges

Will touch on this a bit more in an upcoming blog post, but as part of maintaining expertise in the Salesforce ecosystem I&#8217;ve set a goal to stay current on <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead" target="_blank">Trailhead</a> modules. My current job only touches on a subset of the platform, so Trailhead has proven to be a nice way to get some pointed hands-on experience with features I wouldn&#8217;t use on a normal project.

I <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/ForumsTrailheadProfile?userId=005F00000043LNOIA2" target="_blank">already have 51</a> of them already done thanks to a couple weekends in November, so finishing the last 20 shouldn&#8217;t be terrible. The overall goal is to end 2016 at 100% completion based on however many new modules come out during the calendar year as well.

## Certifications

Salesforce rolled out some new certifications during the second half of 2015, and I still need to take (and pass) the <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/campaigns/success-services/developer-certification-in-progress.jsp" target="_blank">Platform Developer I & II Transition Exam</a>.

As a bit more of a stretch, I&#8217;ve been eyeing the <a href="http://certification.salesforce.com/pardot" target="_blank">Pardot certifications</a> for a year now, and would like to knock those out in an effort to increase my knowledge of the platform.

## Present 1 Session at Dreamforce

Pretty self explanatory; I had a blast last year <a href="http://michaelwelburn.com/2015/10/02/a-belated-dreamforce-2015/" target="_blank">presenting 2 sessions</a> at Dreamforce, and would love to present again this year. Already starting to think about different topics to submit.

## Contribute 12 Pull Requests to Open Source

This one is a bit new for me, as I haven&#8217;t made much of an effort in this department in the past besides an ad-hoc bug fix or two. As a way to give back (and keep my skills sharp) I&#8217;ve set a goal of submitting 1 pull request a month to any open source project.

## Ship Some Apps

Like most people, I come up with useful ideas (usually only useful to myself) for apps all the time. Sometimes I even start working on them. Very infrequently do I finish them before losing interest. This year there are 2 different app types that I want to ship, which is defined by actually listing them on their respective stores:

**1 AppExchange App**

<a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">AppExchange</a> is Salesforce&#8217;s version of an App Store. My goal is to create some sort of free app, likely a Lightning Component, and go through the process of deploying it to the store.

**1 Ionic (iOS) App**

While I don&#8217;t have the patience to <a href="http://michaelwelburn.com/2014/08/13/goal-accomplished-incredibly-simple-native-ios-app-app-store/" target="_blank">re-learn the native language(s)</a> for writing iOS apps after more than a year of not touching it, I am interested in leveraging <a href="http://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> to build an iOS app in order to learn about that technology.

# Get off the Computer

## Read 18 Books

I  was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/mwelburn" target="_blank">reading</a> at a rather voracious pace through the middle of 2014, but the last 18 months I have read very infrequently. As part of the greater goal to not stare at a computer screen (does E Ink count?), I&#8217;m looking to read 18 books in total. I&#8217;d like to make at least 6 of the books &#8220;work-related&#8221;, but giving myself some leeway to just read anything for the other 12.

## 30+ minutes of Woodworking (3x/month)

My primary hobby that isn&#8217;t computer-related is woodworking, through a variety of different styles. While I am rather limited living in an apartment with creaky floors at the moment (ruling out the power tools), I do have the tools for whittling and <a href="http://michaelwelburn.com/2014/07/20/relief-carving-apartment/" target="_blank">relief carving</a>.

Last year there was very minimal woodworking; only a few trips to the power tools stored in my parents&#8217; basement for scroll sawing and woodturning. This year my goal is to focus on the hand tools and create a reasonable cadence of spending some dedicated time 3x a month.

## Exercise (Run 3x/week, Lift 3x/week)

This one went pretty well for 80% of 2015. My wife and I ran the NYC Marathon on November 1, so there was roughly 6-8 months of training that focused on running 4-5 times a week. Of course, once that goal is accomplished&#8230;that cadence fell off a bit. In any case, running 3+ miles 3x a week (or equivalent cardio workout) shouldn&#8217;t be an issue.

On the other hand, I have always ignored strength training. This will be more annoying to be diligent about, but I&#8217;m setting a goal here of 30+ minutes 3x a week.

## Learn Spanish (30+ min 5x/week)

A recurring theme from my 2014 list. I have what LinkedIn calls elementary proficiency in Spanish based on 4 years in high school, but it is essentially just knowing a good amount of vocabulary without being particularly adept at holding a conversation. While that is good enough to survive in a foreign country, I have a goal of being conversational at some point (which I would define as not having to translate between Spanish and English in my head before talking).

Since the end result is not something I can track quantifiable progress on, instead I&#8217;ll shoot for 30+ minutes of practice 5x/week through conversing with my wife or apps like <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">duolingo</a>.
