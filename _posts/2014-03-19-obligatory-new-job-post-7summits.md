[<img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 20px;" alt="7Summits" src="http://michaelwelburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/7Summits_Square_Logo_large.jpg" width="235" height="235" />](http://michaelwelburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/7Summits_Square_Logo_large.jpg)I&#8217;ve been a bit lazy on the blogging front lately, but I do have the exciting news that I recently joined a new company at the end of February, <a title="7Summits" href="http://7summitsagency.com" target="_blank">7Summits</a>! I&#8217;ll be focusing on building branded internal and external communities as part of a new Force.com based practice. They have built some really impressive implementations on the <a title="Jive" href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/" target="_blank">Jive platform</a> in the past (including the <a title="MSOE" href="http://www.7summitsagency.com/portfolio-items/msoe-milwaukee-school-of-engineering/" target="_blank">Milwaukee School of Engineering</a>), and I&#8217;m hoping to glean some knowledge of how the user experience team works to add to my stack of skills.<!--more-->

While I&#8217;ll miss my coworkers at <a title="Sonoma Partners" href="http://sonomapartners.com" target="_blank">Sonoma Partners</a>, it&#8217;s an exciting opportunity for me to get to work on some aspects of the Force.com platform beyond CRM, and hopefully get my hands dirty on some web-based technologies.

I do have a backload of ideas for blogs (some more in depth than others), but have just not had enough focus to crank out a bunch of them to get me through the next month or two. Hopefully I&#8217;ll find a block of time this weekend or next to get those written and queued up.

Beyond the blogs, I&#8217;ve started trying to focus a bit on getting some base proficiency on the <a title="MEAN stack" href="http://www.mean.io/" target="_blank">MEAN</a> stack, which has some relevant usage for my new role, and I still have the elusive &#8220;build an iOS application&#8221; as <a title="New Year’s Resolutions for 2014" href="http://michaelwelburn.com/2014/01/01/new-years-resolutions-for-2014/" target="_blank">a goal this year</a>. Between those two, and my current ramp up to trying to run a half marathon at the end of May with <a title="Vibram Fivefingers" href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Vibram Fivefingers</a>, hopefully there are some interesting posts going forward!
