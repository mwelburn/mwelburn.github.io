This evening I found out that the <a title="#salesforce1selfie" href="https://twitter.com/MichaelWelburn/status/462381751588114432" target="_blank">#salesforce1selfie</a> that I submitted as part of an earlier blog post, <a title="Building a Wellness Tracking App on Salesforce1 in a Couple Hours" href="http://michaelwelburn.com/2014/05/06/building-wellness-tracking-app-salesforce1-in-a-couple-hours/" target="_blank">Building a Wellness Tracking App on Salesforce1 in a Couple Hours</a>, was selected as part of an eBook that Salesforce put out called <a title="NEW E-BOOK: 100 Ways to Run Your Business from Your Phone" href="http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2014/06/new-e-book-100-ways-to-run-your-business-from-your-phone.html?d=70130000000tP4G" target="_blank">100 Ways to Run Your Business from Your Phone</a>.

This was definitely unexpected, as I just submitted a #salesforce1selfie for fun, but pretty awesome to be one of the top 100. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t make the <a title="How the 10 #salesforce1selfie Winners Run Their Business from Their Phones" href="http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2014/06/salesforce1selfie.html" target="_blank">top 10</a>, or I&#8217;d have a free ticket to Dreamforce ðŸ™‚

Below is a screenshot of my entry in the eBook. Give it a <a title="NEW E-BOOK: 100 Ways to Run Your Business from Your Phone" href="http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2014/06/new-e-book-100-ways-to-run-your-business-from-your-phone.html?d=70130000000tP4G" target="_blank">download to see the rest</a>.
