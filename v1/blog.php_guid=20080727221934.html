Rod Smith Retires	</h3><h2>
Posted July 27 2008 10:19PM by Michael	</h2><h1>
<p><a target="_blank" href="images/blog/20080727221934.jpg"><img border=0 align="right" src="images/blog/thumbnail/20080727221934.jpg" alt="Rod Smith"></a>It has been an inevitable event for the last couple of years of injury, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_9976756">Rod Smith has finally decided to retire</a>. This officially robs me of my favorite athlete of my young life. I remember proudly wearing my Rod Smith jersey to middle school for the Super Bowls. I still am waiting to find a discount for an authentic Rod Smith Denver Broncos jersey, but someday I am sure I will give in. For more information on how this occurred, let me direct you to the <a target="_blank" href="rodsmith.php.html">tale of a young child</a>.</p>

<p>Now I know what you must be thinking: who are my remaining favorite players? The answer to that is simple.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Basketball: Deron Williams</b><br/>
	<i>Played at Illinois, is a beast. Even gets me cheering for the Jazz (and actually got me to watch NBA games). I used to have Richard Hamilton as a favorite player in his Wizard days, but ever since he became a Piston we have drifted apart. His game is exactly like how I would ideally play, minus the whole part about him being in shape.<br/><br/>I can also proudly say that I actually bought a Beckett graded rookie card (probably the plainest looking one around, nothing special about it whatsoever) when he was terrible his rookie year. Last time I checked there were 59 cards graded 9.5 and I had the only 10.</i><br/><br/>
	<li><b>Football: Arrelious Benn</b><br/>
	<i>Playing at Illinois, is also a beast. Great timing as the torch was passed to him from Rod last year. I actually planned my day around his college announcement on that cold November day.</i><br/><br/>
	<li><b>Baseball: None</b><br/>
	<i>I wanted to force someone like Troy Tulowitzki or Carlos Marmol here, but I just can't. I'm not all that sure I've ever had a 'favorite' baseball player.</i>
	</li>
</ul>
