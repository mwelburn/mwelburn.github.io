Official Start Date	</h3><h2>
Posted April 14 2008 6:01PM by Michael	</h2><h1>
<p>I finally officially have set my start date for entering the real world: May 27. It was really only a matter of time, as I don't believe I could find enough things to keep me busy all summer (the other option was after Labor day). For those of you unaware, I will be working at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tsgrp.com/">Technology Services Group</a> (TSG), doing document-based consulting work. More specifically, I am a <a target="_blank" href="http://tsgrp.com/careers/web-developer.jsp">'Web Application Developer'</a>. I must say that I am kind of intrigued by it, and am excited to start. I am also excited to eat lunch with my dad, who currently works at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.navteq.com/">Navteq</a>, at the nearby train station, possibly at one of those tables that are at waist level where you stand up and eat around them. This means that I will have slightly over two weeks between graduation and beginning work, which is a little less than ideal, but hopefully after my vacation to Puerto Rico (May 18-24) with Joyce and friends, I will be ready to go. And hopefully not sunburned.</p>

<p>Also, I have 5 more blog entries pre-written up, so be sure to check back daily. I'll probably release one every day this week to space them out (and keep you in suspense).</p><!--	Tags:
