The Battle of Pears	</h3><h2>
Posted April 16 2008 5:04PM by Michael	</h2><h1>
<p><a target="_blank" href="images/blog/20080416170405.jpg"><img border=0 src="images/blog/thumbnail/20080416170405.jpg" align="right" alt="Wannabe asian pear"></a>While at Walmart yesterday, I decided to procure some fresh fruit (possibly, and quite likely, my last fresh fruit run before I graduate). I then decided to acquire some pears. That is where our story begins.</p>

<p>Now normally, in the small rural town of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora%2C_Illinois">Aurora</a>, my mom usually seems to purchase <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosc_Pear">bosc pears</a>. Since I don't like to deviate from what has already been declared as good, I made a bee-line to them. However, something else caught my fathers eye: an <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_pyrifolia">asian pear</a>.</p>

<p>Now this was no ordinary piece of fruit. It was shaped simalarly to an orange, instead of the usual pear-like shape I am used to. However, that was not the most striking feature of this fruit...it had it's own styrofoam-mesh covering. Had I not been in shock at the time, I would have taken a picture of all 100 (give or take) asian pears in uniform. Sadly, it didn't even dawn on me to blog about this until after I had already devoured the asian pear.</p>

<p>I decided to compare the two types of pear, for future reference. While the bosc pear remained delicious, the asian pear set new standards for what a pear should taste like. It was much juicier (waterier?), and had the taste of a dessert. In fact, they remind me of another delicious food of my past, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee">lychee</a>. I may have been biased while eating it, wanting to believe that any fruit that came in a uniform must be more delicious, but I will continue to believe myself.</p>

<p>On the right I have photographed a rogue bosc pear masquarading as an asian pear.</p>
