Too Much to Say	</h3><h2>
Posted April 10 2008 7:40PM by Michael	</h2><h1>
<p>There genuinely is just too much information for me to regurgitate into this blog, but I will try my best (now that I have turned in my homework) to put down some of my thoughts:</p>

<ul><li>The Denver Broncos have ZERO wide receivers with numbers in the 80's according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverbroncos.com/page.php?id=396">DenverBroncos.com</a>. This is pretty baffling, and likely is because no WR on their team has earned the opportunity to wear a real number (either due to lack of on-field production or punching a TV)
<li>Troy Tulowitzki walks to the plate to the sounds of 'I'm a flirt' by R. Kelly. I don't know how to describe this, except for the fact that it makes him even better.
<li>I am still doing my best to figure out how to get my hands on an authentic Arrelious Benn jersey, but it doesn't even look like the athletic department can help me out (pending a response from  one last person that I remain hopeful will respond positively).
<li>I also officially purchased a pair of Illinois football season tickets for next season (basically for the price of going to the Ohio State game), and am now excited to make that 3 hour drive up to 6 times this fall. Therefore, due to my love of Illinois football, they should be begging me to proudly wear an authentic jersey (PLEASE).
<li>I have purchased the majority of parts to build a massive server, including two 1 terabyte hard drives running (likely) RAID 1. The website may be down a little this weekend as I try to transition to that.
</li></ul>

<p>You will also notice a slight change in the fonts on the site, now that I am back online I remembered that I needed to play around with that a little to make it less boring.</p><!--	Tags:
