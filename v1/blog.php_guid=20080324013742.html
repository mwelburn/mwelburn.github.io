Website Down	</h3><h2>
Posted March 24 2008 1:37AM by Michael	</h2><h1>
<p>Unfortunately, over Spring Break our internet at school decided to kind of stop working, which was the reason for the site being down from about Wednesday until Sunday night. I apologize that you are now 4 days behind in my life, but now that I am back at school there should be no more extended downtimes.</p>

<p>A couple of quick updates on some of the previous blog entries:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>After hitting a scorching .400 (including a month over .500) in my MLB: The Show single player mode, the game decided to freeze. I hadn't saved since before my scorching final month, and therefore was devasted enough to stop playing until I begin playing as the actual team. Heartbreaking. However I was dominating the Rookie of the Year voting, and at least discovered that I should be playing on Hall of Fame difficulty (unless the computer was trying to make me feel good about myself).
		<li>I unfortunately only picked 21 of the 32 games in the first round of the NCAA tournament correctly, and only 9 of the 16 second round games. Somehow this still puts me very close to the top of the family rankings.
		<li>On a brighter note, despite knowing absolutely nothing about women's college basketball outside of the words "Candace Parker", I managed to pick 24 of the 32 first round games correctly. Unfortunately, my quest of getting all 63 games of the women's tournament correct (and subsequently getting interviewed by ESPN, where I disclose that entering this free contest was a joke and I know nothing about women's basketball) will have to wait another year.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>I'm hoping that in the near future I will <i>finally</i> get cookies up and running, unfortunately the downtime during my week off kind of derailed all of my progress.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, here is an interesting video of a dog playing fetch with himself my dad found:</p>
