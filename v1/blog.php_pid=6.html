	Site Issues		</a></h3><h2>
	Posted March 16 2008 2:28AM by Michael		</h2><h1>
	<p>As a quick update for those of you who have my <a target="_blank" href="rss.xml">RSS feed</a> bookmarked, I basically spent the entire day trying to set up subversion. Obviously I failed, or else this post would have a more upbeat tone. Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.michaelpysson.com">Michael Pysson's</a> ability to scan UNIX command line, my apache server was only down for about 20 minutes in the middle of the night.</p>
				<p>I believe the new goal for tomorrow is to set up a database to hold these blog entries, as well as enabling comments from the blog. If only I had Visio to design the database schema...(something I could do by hand in likely 10% of the time, but in an ugly manner).</p>
				<p>In other words, I give up for the night.</p>		</h1><h2>

	<p>Perhaps you came across this site on accident, searching for one of the many Michael Welburn's that seem to have a MySpace page (that currently seems to be outranking my own page in the google search), or more likely you made your way to my site on purpose.</p><p>While nothing on this page should work (yet), I wanted to have an easily accessable list of things that need to be accomplished before this site is no longer beta:</p>

<p><ul><li>Web Counter

					<li>RSS Feed

					<li>Sessions

					<li>Finish CSS

					<li>Create Content

					<li>Set up database for blog

					<li>Set up photo album

					<li>If you have any other brilliant ideas, please let me know via email. And if you don't know my email, and cannot look it up on facebook, and you are on this site, then I am far too popular for my own good. (Fortunately for you there is a link at the bottom of the page).

				</ul></p>

				

				<p>Unfortunately for the viewing public (but fortunately for my bandwidth), I decided to not use flash in this iteration of MW.com. However, in all seriousness, something still seems too old looking about this website. If you can pinpoint it, or give any suggestions, please do.</p>
				
      <p>In due time, the tabs at the top of the screen will begin to work. Feel free to check back reguarly. In the mean time, please visit <a href="http://www.michaelpysson.com" target="_blank">michaelpysson.com</a> or <a href="http://lostinthemoment.com" target="_blank">lostinthemoment.com</a></p>		</h1><h2>
