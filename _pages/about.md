I’m a Salesforce technical architect and web developer currently living in San Francisco (originally from Chicago), where I work remotely for <a title="7Summits" href="http://7summitsagency.com" target="_blank">7Summits</a>. I’ve done a lot of work on enterprise level web applications, and am now consulting on <a title="Salesforce.com" href="http://salesforce.com" target="_blank">Salesforce.com</a> implementations and customizations. I&#8217;ve got a ton of experience with all parts of the software development lifecycle (the nature of being part of small teams is you end up doing everything), but designing and implementing challenging and &#8220;cool&#8221; stuff is what gets me excited. While I have worked extensively with Java in the past, I do a ton of Apex / Visualforce right now and mix in some Javascript when I can (and when time permits, get in some Rails and Objective-C for fun).

Other interesting facts about me:

  * I spent most of my life telling people that running was too boring to do as exercise. Then my wife wanted to run a marathon; 8 months of training later, and we had <a title="Chicago Marathon 2012: Completed" href="http://michaelwelburn.com/2012/10/13/chicago-marathon-2012-completed/" target="_blank">finished the 2012 Chicago Marathon</a>. You can follow my intermittent progress on <a title="DailyMile" href="http://www.dailymile.com/people/br0nc080" target="_blank">DailyMile</a>. **Update:** I&#8217;ve since added the 2015 NYC Marathon to my belt.
  * I’m a big Denver Broncos fan, as well as an Illini fan. I experienced both a National Championship (loss) in basketball and a Rose Bowl (loss) in football during my time in Champaign. After graduating, the sports outlook has been a lot more depressing.
  * I have done some woodworking as a hobby, primarily on a lathe or whittling. Not enough lately, though. Here is a throwback to my original blog, where I made a <a title="Jewelry Box" href="http://michaelwelburn.com/v1/jewelrybox.php.html" target="_blank">post</a> about my first time using the scroll saw.
  * I enjoy photography, and intermittently upload photos to <a title="500px" href="http://500px.com/br0nc080" target="_blank">500px</a> or <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/br0nc080" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.
