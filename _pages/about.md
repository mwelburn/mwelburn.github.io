Thanks for stopping by to learn a little more about my background.

Work Experience
--
I'm currently employed at [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) as a Salesforce Architect and Engineering Manager. 

Prior to that, I spent 6+ years consulting on the Salesforce platform. Over that time, I've accumulated a wealth of [Salesforce certifications](http://certification.salesforce.com/verification?&fullname=Michael%20Welburn) and delivered 3 presentations at Dreamforce, both recognizing my vast knowledge of the ecosystem.

I've filled a vast majority of the roles on the delivery side of implementations, working at smaller companies without the separation of responsibilities you might find at a larger company.

* Technical Architect
* Solution Architect
* Business Analyst
* Developer
* Administrator

Prior to working on Salesforce, I spent a few years consulting on Documentum, primarily building migration tools and portals on the Java stack.

Personal
--
Currently residing in San Francisco, I grew up in the Chicago suburbs and spent a few years in New York City. I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.

Other interesting facts about me:

  * I used to play (and watch) a lot of videogames. Fortunately, I work at a company where this has some professional upside. Unfortunately, being a parent has made this difficult to maintain.
  * I spent most of my life telling people that running was too boring to do as exercise (and being terrible at it). Then my wife wanted to run a marathon; 8 months of training later, and we had <a title="Chicago Marathon 2012: Completed" href="http://michaelwelburn.com/2012/10/13/chicago-marathon-2012-completed/" target="_blank">finished the 2012 Chicago Marathon</a>. And then she wanted to do another, and we finished the 2015 New York City Marathon. And then for whatever reason, I ran the 2017 Chicago Marathon by myself. I remain terrible at it, but apparently enjoy pain more than I thought.
  * I’m a big Denver Broncos fan, as well as an Illini fan. I experienced both a National Championship (loss) in basketball and a Rose Bowl (loss) in football during my time in Champaign. After graduating, the sports outlook has been a lot more depressing.
  * I have done some woodworking as a hobby, primarily on a lathe or whittling. Here is a throwback to my original blog, where I made a <a title="Jewelry Box" href="http://michaelwelburn.com/v1/jewelrybox.php.html" target="_blank">post</a> about my first time using the scroll saw. Now moving into the world of "apartment-friendly" hand tools...
  * I enjoy photography, and <s>intermittently</s> no longer upload photos to <a title="500px" href="http://500px.com/br0nc080" target="_blank">500px</a> or <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/br0nc080" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.
